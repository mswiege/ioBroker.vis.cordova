ioBroker.vis.cordova
============

WEB visualisation for ioBroker platform as android App.

You still need ioBroker and installed vis to create views.

## How to build

```
npm install 
grunt release
or 
grunt build
```

To test it on android Handy:
```
cordova run android
```

## Control interface
Vis creates 3 variables:

- control.instance - Here the browser instance should be written or FFFFFFFF if every browser must be controlled.
- control.data     - Parameter for command. See specific command description.
- control.command  - Command name. Write this variable triggers the command. That means before command will be written the "instance" and "data" must be prepared with data.

Commands:

* alert - show alert window in vis. "control.data" has following format "message;title;jquery-icon". Title and jquery-icon are optional. Icon names can be found [here](http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/). To show icon "ui-icon-info" write ```Message;;info```.
* changeView - switch to desired view. "control.data" must have name of view. You can specify project name too as "project/view". Default project is "main".
* refresh - reload vis, for instance after project is changed to reload on all browsers.
* reload - same as refresh.
* dialog - Show dialog window. Dialog must exist on view. One of:

    - "static    - HTML    - Dialog",
    - "static    - Icon    - Dialog",
    - "container - HTML    - view in jqui Dialog",
    - "container - ext cmd - view in jqui Dialog",
    - "container - Icon    - view in jqui Dialog",
    - "container - Button  - view in jqui Dialog".

    "control.data" must have id of dialog widget, e.g. "w00056".
* popup - opens a new browser window. Link must be specified in "control.data", e.g. http://google.com
* playSound - play sound file. The link to file is specified in "control.data", e.g. http://www.modular-planet.de/fx/marsians/Marsiansrev.mp3.
  You can upload your own file in vis and let it play as for instance "/vis.0/main/img/myFile.mp3".

If user changes the view or at start the variables will be filled by vis with

- "control.instance": browser instance and ack=true
- "control.data": project and view name in form "project/view", e.g. "main/view" (and ack=true)
- "control.command": "changedView" and ack=true

You can write the JSON-string or Object into control.command as ```{instance: 'AABBCCDD', command: 'cmd', data: 'ddd'}```. In this case the instance and data will be taken from JSON object.

With command in javascript adapter you can activate text to speech engine of Android:

```setState('vis.0.control.command', '{"instance": "FFFFFFFF", "data":"say something", "command": "tts"}');```
